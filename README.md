This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

I have created a color plate for the site

Primary: #821d30 (Deep, rich color, great for primary actions like buttons, headers, or main elements.)

Secondary: #ffc5d0 (Soft pink tone, perfect for secondary buttons, highlights, or UI elements.)

Accent: #fb0909 (Vibrant red, best used for special highlights, interactive elements, or call-to-action sections.)

Destructive: #fb0909 (Since it's a strong red, itâ€™s perfect for delete buttons, warnings, or error messages.)

Success: #f7d6d0 (A soft, warm color that can work for success messages, confirmations, or positive feedback.)

Muted: #ffc5d0 (A lighter tone that can be used for subtle UI elements, backgrounds, or disabled states.)
